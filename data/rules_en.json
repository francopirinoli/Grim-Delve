It is a game about desperate people exploring dangerous places for gold, glory, and survival.</p><p>In many RPGs, you play as superheroes destined to save the world. In Grim Delve, you are an adventurer. You have grit, steel, and perhaps a spark of magic, but the world does not care if you live or die. If you want to survive, you must be smart, you must be quick, and you must be lucky.</p><h3>What You Need to Play</h3><ul><li><strong>The Players:</strong> 2-5 people to take on the roles of adventurers.</li><li><strong>The Game Master (GM):</strong> One person to portray the world, the monsters, and the challenges.</li><li><strong>Dice:</strong> A standard set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20).</li><li><strong>This App:</strong> To track characters and reference rules.</li></ul>",

        "content": "<p>This game is built on the <strong>Old School Renaissance (OSR)</strong> style of play, mixed with modern mechanics. Understanding these pillars is key to enjoying the game.</p><h3>1. Player Skill over Character Skill</h3><p>The rules do not solve problems; <strong>you</strong> do. Do not look at your character sheet to find a \"Solve Trap\" button. Instead, look at the GM and ask, \"I use my ten-foot pole to tap the floor tiles.\" If you describe a sensible action, you might succeed without rolling a die at all.</p><h3>2. Combat is War, Not Sport</h3><p>Combat is not balanced to be \"fair.\" It is a fail-state. If you find yourself in a fair fight, your tactics have failed. Use dirty tricks, bottlenecks, traps, and diplomacy. If you can avoid a fight and still get the gold, you have won.</p><h3>3. Treasure is Power</h3><p>You do not gain Experience Points (XP) for killing monsters. Violence is a risk that costs resources (HP, Spells). You gain XP by recovering <strong>Treasure</strong> and bringing it back to civilization. This aligns your motivation: get the gold and get out alive.</p><h3>4. The World is Dangerous</h3><p>Magic is volatile. Monsters are terrifying. The darkness is real. There are no safety nets here. If you drop to 0 HP, you are dying. If you make a mistake, you pay for it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Grim Delve uses a unique engine designed for speed and tension.</p><h3>The Player-Facing Roll</h3><p>The <strong>GM never rolls dice</strong>. Players roll to attack, and players roll to defend. This keeps the action centered on you. When a dragon breathes fire, the GM describes the horror, and you roll to survive it.</p><h3>The Danger Pool</h3><p>Because the GM doesn't roll attacks, they use <strong>Danger Points (DP)</strong>. When players fail rolls or defeat enemies, the tension rises (represented by DP). The GM spends these points to trigger boss abilities, summon reinforcements, or spring traps. The longer you linger, the more dangerous the dungeon becomes.</p><h3>Slot-Based Inventory</h3><p>We do not track weight in pounds. We track <strong>Slots</strong>. You have a limited number of inventory slots (usually 8-12). A sword takes 1 slot. A ration takes 1 slot. A sack of 100 gold coins takes 1 slot. You will constantly have to choose: <em>\"Do I carry this extra potion, or do I carry the loot?\"</em></p><h3>Modular Classes</h3><p>You are not locked into a single path. Your class is a combination of two <strong>Archetypes</strong>. Combine <em>Soldier</em> + <em>Arcanist</em> to make a Spellblade. Combine <em>Rogue</em> + <em>Priest</em> to make a Pilgrim. Your identity is yours to forge.</p>",
